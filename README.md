<h1> 2D Lunar Lander using Reinforcement Learning </h1>

<h3> Using the Gym 2D Lunar Lander as a model for a PyTorch Reinforcement Learning project, the resulting model could land within the designated area within X number of steps. The model had 3 movement operations which included left, right, and thrust up with gravity as the acting force. This project's source can be easily modified to included different forms of resistance such as air resistance, etc. <h3>
